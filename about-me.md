Hi, Iâ€™m Kuba. 

Several years ago, I chose Math studies over playing football, as I realised I am not good enough at the latter. Now I try to combine both of these passions in my professional career, where I apply data science methods to gain a better insight into this beautiful game. Since the beginning of 2021, I offer professional consultancy services in the field of football analytics. I have working experience with various event and tracking data sources, and building models for data scouting or opposition analysis purposes.

In recent years, I was shortlisted twice in a row for a presentation at OptaPro Forum, the biggest football analytics conference in Europe. Please check out the write-ups or my other public work posted on this blog or my GitHub profile.

If you find my work interesting and would like to discuss it further, you can reach me out at kuba.michalczyk[at]gmail.com. I am also present on Twitter and LinkedIn.
