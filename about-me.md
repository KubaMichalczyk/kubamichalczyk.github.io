title: About me

Hi, I'm Kuba (actually it's Jakub, but I prefer the former). Few years ago I have chosen Math studies over football, as I was not good enough at the latter. Now, in my spare time, I try to combine both those passions by applying data science methods to football in order to gain a better insight into this beautiful game. By day I work as Data Scientist in a media agency.

You can reach me out at kuba.michalczyk[at]gmail.com.
